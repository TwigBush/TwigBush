### 3. Submitting Code

* Fork the repo and create a feature branch from `main`.
* Keep commits atomic and well-described.
* Add unit tests for new functionality.
* Run `go fmt ./...` and `go test ./...` before opening a PR.
* Open a Pull Request (PR) against `main` with a clear title and description.
* Sign your commits using [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/).

### 4. Review Process

go fmt ./...

# Run tests
go test ./...

# Start the Authorization Server
go run ./cmd/as
